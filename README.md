Deploy complex applications in style!

## Overview
push2cloud is a framework that allows you to easily deploy complex applications onto Cloud Foundry. push2cloud consists of multiple pluggable components that work together to give maximum customizability to the user and use-case.

## Architecture
The basic push2cloud architecture consists of manifests, the compiler to process them and various workflows to deploy. A complete overview of the architecture can be found [here](docs/architecture.md).

## Getting started
```bash
# get push2cloud
git clone https://github.com/push2cloud/push2cloud.git
cd push2cloud/example/deployer
npm install

# install the cli
npm install -g push2cloud-cli

# set your CF target (api, space, org), adopt serviceMappings & domains
vi ../manifests/deployment.json

# set your CF credentials
export CF_USER=${YOUR_USER}
export CF_PWD=${YOUR_PASSWORD}

# compile
p2c compile -e ../manifests/deployment.json -c

# deploy
p2c exec ./node_modules/push2cloud-cf-workflows/simple.js
```
